** About This file
This is my personal config. It's really long, but that's partly because I sometimes leave blog posts in it as commentary. (And also because I've got a lot of little customizations that I might not even remember. =)). If you want to see a table of contents and other useful niceties, go to http://sachachua.com/dotemacs. Othe links for this page: Org Mode version, Github repository
If you're new to Emacs Lisp, you probably don't want to copy and paste large chunks of this code. Instead, copy small parts of it (always making sure to copy a complete set of parentheses) into your *scracth* buffer or some other buffer in emacs-lisp-mode. Use M-x eval-buffer to evaluate the code and see if you like the way that Emacs behaves. See An Introduction to Programming in Emacs Lisp.
